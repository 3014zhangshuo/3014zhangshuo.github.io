在push heroku的时候出现
`uninitialized constant CarrierWave::Storage::Fog(NameError)`

Since `require` works with `$LOAD_PATH` and my Rails app has `lib` in its load path, I did the following:
`$ touch lib/fog.rb`
where the file contains the following
```
module Fog
  # :D
end
```
and then in my CarrierWave initializer I did the following:
```
require 'carrierwave/storage/abstract'
require 'carrierwave/storage/file'
require 'carrierwave/storage/fog'

CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  …
```
heroku run bundle install
the app then works with `fog-aws`
