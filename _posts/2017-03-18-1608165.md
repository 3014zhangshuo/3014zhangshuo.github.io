<h1>Database  insert the array value problem</h1>
we want to create  a system mentor assgin the resume to edit, just like a task. I want to create a model that have a user_id column this is a integer type, a resume_id column type is a integer too. and I want to thought the rails collection_check_boxes to create multiple resume_id just like a array name of resume_ids. but this not work the box can remove the resume_id of the user origin. because the user and resume have the associate though the user_id and resume_id . they can them primary_key i guess. this answer is not right . second i try to add_coulmn resume_ids to task  model this type is string array is ture default "[]" ["answer_postion"](https://coderwall.com/p/sud9ja/rails-4-the-postgresql-array-data-type) there some tip to remenber default value must cover the "" ，and  the task model can't build the relationship beacuse
taks model not have the resume_id, the resume table can't find the task throught the assoicate. and we let the strong params pass the array value add `:resume_ids => []` to  strong params and now the  collection_check_boxes 
```
<%= collection_check_boxes(:mentor_task, :resume_ids, Resume.where(:is_paid => true).where(:is_assign => false), :id, :id, include_hidden: false, checked:Resume.where(:is_paid => true).where(:is_assign => false).first.id ) %>
```
base the this code block we have some must notice the boxes will be have the hide input and this value is empty. this will be cause  the error when we select all the resume throught the resume_ids. will be a empty id not found. we must add `include_hidden => false` office api tourial `html_options: { :include_hidden => false }`
,but we dont't need add html_options . we just follow the order to add we want [aims.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26410053/rails-4-checkbox-collection-cant-get-include-hidden-false-to-work) [how to remove the empty string form the array](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26114332/remove-nil-and-blank-string-in-an-array-in-ruby).[hash version](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3450641/removing-all-empty-elements-from-a-hash-yaml) [and any? method](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6245929/check-for-array-not-empty-any)
can pass the value and insert the database. but i want to select  one task all resume_is from the ids. I got the resume_ids is the array in a string  They can't use the `where(:id => :resume_ids)` to select. must convert array can be work .see the 2 link `Resume.where(:id=> JSON.parse(:resume_ids)`
In the rails 3 we user the `find_all_by_id`, now use where replace the old. ok everything fine in the development env. but sadly when we deploy the produciton env the pg database we create the new task 
give me a error the typeerror `no implicit conversion the array to string`,find the `5` this is a answer I can find add 
`serialize :softwarename, Array` to task model.
and remove all the JSON.parse. now the error not appeal again. but the array not insert the database.
base the `9` we remove the `serialize :softwarename, Array` and change the column`t.string :resume_ids` this will be work on the test production but the real server will be add `serialize :softwarename, Array` can be work. i don't why????? perhaps the database confusion beacause i 
rollback so many time in the development env
